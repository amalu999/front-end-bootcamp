<p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is used to design web pages using a markup language.
HTML is a combination of Hypertext and Markup language. Hypertext defines the link between web pages. 
A markup language is used to define the text document within the tag which defines the structure of web pages.
</p>
<p>An HTML heading tag is used to define the headingsof a page. There are six levels of headings defined by HTML. 
These 6 heading elements are h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6; with h1 being the highest level and h6 being the least.
</p>
<p>The tag in HTML defines a paragraph. These have both opening and closing tags. So anything mentioned within and 
is treated as a paragraph. Most browsers read a line as a paragraph even if we donâ€™t use the closing tag i.e,
but this may raise unexpected results. So, it is a good convention, and we must use the closing tag.
